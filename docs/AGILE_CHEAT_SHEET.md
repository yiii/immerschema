### üßë‚Äçüíª Agile Mapping Cheat-Sheet

| Agile level | File / Collection | Typical owner |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Theme** | portfolio.yml | Studio exec / strategy |
| **Initiative** | project.json | Executive producer |
| **Epic** | epicId field in scene or feature | Department lead |
| **Feature** | features.json (optional) | Tech/art lead |
| **Story** | stories/*.json | Cross-functional squad |
| **Task** | tasks/*.json | Individual contributor |

If you skip features for now, keep a free `featureTag` on stories or tasks. Later, add `featureId` and create a matching entry in `features.json`.
